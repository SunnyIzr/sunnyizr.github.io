# clasp-quiz

This is a template to generate static websites.
To get started:
1. run "npm install"
2. run "grunt build"

And then when you're ready to start development, run "grunt watch"

- You should be coding the HTML in the /pages folder. The quiz should be written into pages/index.html.
- You'll be able to use partials, that are located in the /include folder. You can see how the partials are used in the pages/index.html file.
- For scripts, if you need to run anything on document.ready, you can input that in scripts/script.js
- For CSS, you can add the actual styling within the /styles folder using SCSS format ("`_`[filename].scss") and then include that SCSS file into syles/style.scss
- To actually view the website, you can open for_deploy/index.html in your browser.
- All fonts and images will be placed in the for_deploy/fonts and for_deploy/images folders.
