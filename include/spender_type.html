		<p>Do you find yourself aimlessly filling up your
			Amazon cart during an afternoon lull? Do you have a
			shirt whose permanent residence is the back of your closet,
			but you had to buy it because it was on sale? We are often
			irrational when it comes to money; retail therapy is a
			real thing people. You start the month off with the best
			financial intentions, but your feelings can sneak up on
			you and derail your budget. Have you ever purchased
			something on a whim and later experienced serious buyers
			remorse? Whether these purchases are because you are bored
			or stressed, fall into the trap of peer-pressure or can’t pass
			up an awesome deal, it’s important to have awareness on what
			emotions drive our spending behavior.</p>

		<p>Think you already know what your emotional vices are? I wouldn’t
			be so sure, your feelings can mislead you and tempt you to blow your
			budget. It’s important to get to know your emotional spending habit,
			to really live your best life. Most of us would like to believe that
			we aren’t pressured into purchases or that we don’t spend money just
			because we are stressed, but in reality, our emotions play a larger
			role than we think.  </p>

		<p>Take our quiz to learn more about what your emotional drivers are.
			It isn’t likely that you will be able to stop making emotional purchases
			entirely, but by bringing some awareness into the picture, hopefully you
			can decrease the damage to your bank account.  So what are you waiting
			for? See if your assumptions about yourself hold up--take the quiz now.</p>
