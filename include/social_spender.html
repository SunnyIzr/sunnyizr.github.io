        <p>You are a social spender. Whether it is due to the fear of
          missing out or peer pressure from your friends you can't
          help but spend money in social situations. Social spenders
          will make every effort to be included in nights out, trips,
          and events. Even if you don't have the money set aside for that
          vacation with your besties you will move money around to make it work.</p>

        <p>Social spenders often find themselves overspending just to keep up
          with their companions. After a night out, do you wake up regretting
          that you spent more than you had intended? Social spenders fear missing out,
          being excluded from their group, and being judged by their peers.</p>

        <p>
          So how do you avoid the peer pressure and stick to
          your budget? First, be honest. Explain your situation
          and your financial goals. Whether you are trying to
          pay off your student loans, buy your first home, or
          save up for future trips, have a heart to heart
          with your friends.</p>

        <p>After you have had a candid conversation, it won't be a
          surprise when you suggest free or inexpensive activities.
          No one said that everything enjoyable must come with a
          price-tag. Come up with low-cost alternatives when your
          friends propose something pricey. Go to a free concert,
          take a hike, or hold off until those Groupon deals arrive.</p>

        <p>Tip number two, get real with your budget. You will probably
          still want to go out with friends on occasion, and unfortunately,
          not everything can be free. See if you can find room in your
          budget to save up for social spending. If your friends
          regularly get drinks on Friday or take an annual trip,
          try to cut back your spending in one area and instead
          allocate it for these events so they don't take you by surprise.</p>
