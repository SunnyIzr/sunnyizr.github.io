    <h3 class="title-content">Our Story</h3>

    <div class="story-block">
      <p>Out of failure comes focus; and kinship springs from unexpected
        corners of life. Our story is no exception.
        <br><br>
        In 2016 Katherine was in the midst of a work sabbatical
        and finally enjoying long-overdue time with her son. Given her
        newly-discovered breathing room she reflected on her past work
        experiences, what she had learned, and how she could grow, all
        in contemplation of her next career move.
        <br><br>
        Sunny was in a similar place, financially and emotionally recovering
        from a recent business setback. Despite his feelings of frustration
        and defeat, his entrepreneurial spirit remained and – true to form –
        an inkling of a new idea emerged. However, Sunny wanted to test this
        new idea and sought advice on how to interview people about their
        finances. And so Sunny was connected to Katherine through a mutual
        <span class="only-for-mobila">friend. Katherine was intrigued by Sunny’s desire to learn and place empathy
          at the core of his idea. Too many times founders are scared to be
          wrong, and here was someone who practically invited it. </span>

        In fact, the more we learned about each other, the more we realized
        how much we shared. How, as creative thinkers and problem-solvers,
        we were often sidelined and brushed off in previous work environments. 
        <br><br>
        We had similar history with money – both of us experienced financial
        volatility during childhood and adulthood; every good habit came at
        the cost of a tough lesson we had to learn on our own.
        <br><br>
        Both of us were determined to not let our past define us but rather
        to <i>drive</i> us. And that led us to a natural conclusion: build a company
        based on empathy.

    <h3 class="title-content">Our Mission</h3>

    <div class="story-block">
      <p>
        <span>Listen First, Design Later</span>
        <br><br>
        We built Clasp side-by-side with real people, beginning with
        understanding their stories and financial lives. As we listened
        we were struck by the amount of shame and pain people felt about
        their past and current behaviors. The self-doubt and criticism.
        The feelings of hopelessness. Feelings that were all-too-familiar
        to both of us. 
        <br><br>
        <span>Financial Wellness = Emotional Wellness</span>
        <br><br>
        At Clasp, we believe financial wellness and emotional wellness are
        intertwined. To get to the heart of financial matters involves
        getting
      </p>

      <p>
        to the heart of what drives us: our emotions.
        <br><br>
        As a result, we’ve replaced lifeless budgeting and passive money-tracking
        with a holistic approach: a long-term plan, plus daily guidance in
        making smart changes and good habits that stick.
        <br><br>
        Money mastery is a continual process; evolving and changing. What worked
        five years ago may not work today. But knowing who you are and what
        motivates you will better prepare you to roll with it when life
        eventually happens.  
        <br><br>
        <span>Come as you are. Let’s get better together.</span>
