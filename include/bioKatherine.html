      <h4>Why did you start Clasp?</h4>
      <p>For me, financial apps always focused on “other” 
        people who had their finances completely optimized 
        and figured out. But if you’re not one of those 
        “others”, financial apps can be overwhelming and sad. 
        I wanted to get away from the “you can’t” and “you shouldn’t” 
        and more into helping people understand themselves. It’s not 
        bad to buy something, as long as that reason is thoughtful 
        and purposeful. Being in control of your finances doesn’t 
        mean you can’t ever buy anything; it means you understand 
        why you’re spending.</p>

      <h4>Why did you choose to work with Sunny?</h4>
      <p>Sunny is just that - Sunny! He’s always bright 
        and optimistic; no challenge is too great. Any time 
        I have a new idea, he listens with an open mind. We 
        get each other; and yet we balance each other out.</p>

      <h4>What is your money story?</h4>
      <p>I’ve always had a complicated relationship with money, 
        and as a result have a mix of good habits and not-so-good 
        habits. Money was never really discussed directly when I was 
        growing up, so a lot of what I know, I’ve had to learn on my own. 
        I’ve made a lot of big mistakes before I discovered what works 
        for me. I define success as knowing yourself and unpacking your 
        bad habits; <span>why did I do that?</span> It’s tough work, but on the 
        upside you understand how to forgive yourself, recognize 
        your good habits, and build from there.</p>

      <h4>What’s your spending style?</h4>
      <p>I’m definitely not a minimalist, and I’m definitely not a “stuff” 
        person. I’m a frivolist! I’m a sucker for ridiculous items that 
        make me laugh. I bought a series of tiny poseable plastic skeletons 
        from Japan and I pose them in a few potted plants around my house. 
        Are they necessary? Absolutely not! Do they make me smile every 
        time I see them? Yes! Are they worth it? YES!</p>

      <h4>What’s your best money hack?</h4>
      <p>Honestly, giving myself a monthly allowance has been the most helpful. 
        I basically automate a monthly allowance to a separate account and that 
        is my fun money - shoes or dining out with friends…whatever I want. 
        But it needs to come out of that account. Plus if I sell something 
        or earn anything extra, I put it back into my fun money account.</p>

    <p>My phone case is my wallet, with a few extras tucked in:</p>

      <p>
        I never carry much cash with me but 
        there are times when I need it. $20 
        is enough to cover most small-sized 
        emergencies (usually tipping)

      <li class="to-top">5. Zoltar Speaks Fortune</li>
      <p>
        From a boardwalk arcade game in Santa Monica. 
        I was with my husband on the boardwalk and tucked 
        it into my wallet. The fortune is not particularly 
        meaningful; in fact it reads like an artificial 
        intelligence program wrote it. Maybe 
        I’m scared to throw it away?

      <li class="to-top">6. Note from Son</li>
      <p>Drawn for me when he was six years old. 
        I would tuck notes into his lunchbox and 
        he decided I should have one too. I believe 
        it is a cat from Neko Atsume along with a 
        rhebus message - “I love you infinity”
      </p>
      <li class="to-top">7. Postage Stamps</li>
      <p>
        Carryover habit from my mom. How many times 
        do you really need a postage stamp? More often 
        than you think you do. Plus, you’re an instant 
        hero to your friends and work colleagues.
