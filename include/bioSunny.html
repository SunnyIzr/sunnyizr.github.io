            <h4>Why did you start Clasp?</h4>
            <p>For me this is personal. When my last company failed, I went from making a lot of money to drowning in business debt in a short amount of time. And that feeling of powerlessness is something I think about a lot as it really clouded my perspective in trying to find a path forward out of what seemed like an impossible situation. Ultimately, I was able to get myself out and redefine my approach to money, an approach that is more self-aware and empowering. My reasons for starting Clasp is to help others redefine their relationship with money in a holistic way that is honest and rooted in emotional self-awareness.</p>
      
            <h4>Why did you choose to work with Katherine?</h4>
            <p>Katherine is one of the most thoughtful women I know. She has this ability to take a problem and deconstruct it to a much deeper level in a way I would have never even thought. When building this company it was so important for me to collaborate with someone who has a deeper perspective on the world and Katherine has just that. I thoroughly enjoy working with her.</p>
      
            <h4>What is your money story?</h4>
            <p>Since my parents were immigrant entrepreneurs, we moved around quite a bit (internationally) and I experienced a lot of income volatility growing up. Because of this, I’ve always been acutely aware of the relationship between finances and emotional well-being.  But after my last company failed pretty badly in 2016, I hit rock bottom financially, and it was at this point I really felt the weight of how money problems can create a tremendous emotional burden. And while I’ve since recovered both financially and emotionally, I strongly believe that managing your own personal finances is inherently an emotional process. And honoring that link between money and mindset is paramount to redefining financial behavior.</p>
      
            <h4>What’s your spending style?</h4>
            <p>My spending style can be summed up in one word, seasonal. If you look at my credit card statements, you’d be convinced that entirely different humans are using my cards during the summer versus the colder months. And that’s because generally during the year, I’m a workaholic and when I’m in the zone, I just don’t have time to spend money. But during summer, all bets are off and I totally let loose. I’m super inclined to buy that extra round of drinks or that pricey pair of sunglasses because YOLO!</p>
      
            <h4>What’s your best money hack?</h4>
            <p style='margin-bottom: 50px;'>I used to have this terrible habit of spending while I was sad. What took months of disciplined savings would be wiped out in a single evening shopping spree after a bad day. So I promised myself I would kick this habit, I mean it’s okay for me to feel sad about a bad day but it’s not okay for me to be destructive about it. My solution? I keep a list on the notes app in my phone of ten free things I can do when I’m feeling sad. And I promise myself that whenever I’m feeling sad, I would do at least 5 of the things on the list *before* making any financial purchases. And so far, I’ve only had one bad shopping spree in the past year!</p>
