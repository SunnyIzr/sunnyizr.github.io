      The <a href=' https://ethereum.org/en/defi/' target='_blank'>DeFi (Decentralized Finance)</a> space has seen tremendous growth over 2021. <a href='https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/total-value-locked-tvl' target="_blank">Total Value Locked (TVL)</a> within DeFI based apps grew to $100+ billion (compared $9 billion a mere 12 months earlier). And we are poised for even greater growth in 2022 as the visibility and excitement around this new frontier intensifies. NYC in particular remains at the forefront of these innovations with many blockchain companies having a strong a presence here.

      Naturally, there’s a huge demand for DeFi Developers and yet there are not many accessible avenues for developers to get involved in the space. Many would agree that the most efficient way to get up to speed in a new domain of knowledge is to collaborate with others, particularly in <a target="_blank" href="https://hbr.org/2020/10/successful-remote-teams-communicate-in-bursts">concentrated periods of time</a>. Ideally, these are done in person but can be done remotely as well.

    <p>
      So we are planning a hackathon in Midtown, New York from Dec 26<sup>th</sup> to Dec 31<sup>st</sup> with the ultimate goal to ship a fully functional DeFi product by the time we wrap up. This hackathon is available for both in-person and virtual participants to attend!

    <p>
      <div style='margin-bottom: -20px;'>This is the hackathon for you if:</div>
      <ul>
        <li>You a developer looking to better understand the crypto and defi space</li>
        <li>You already have familiarity with the crypto space and are looking for other developers to collaborate with</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The period between Christmas and New Year’s Day tends to be a generally quiet time in regards to other professional obligation, What a great opportunity to immerse yourself in another discipline and learn something new! So let’s end the year strong by taking a huge leap into the metaverse.
