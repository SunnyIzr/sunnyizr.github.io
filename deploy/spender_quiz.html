  		<p>Do you find yourself aimlessly filling up your
  			Amazon cart during an afternoon lull? Do you have a
  			shirt whose permanent residence is the back of your closet,
  			but you had to buy it because it was on sale? We are often
  			irrational when it comes to money; retail therapy is a
  			real thing people. You start the month off with the best
  			financial intentions, but your feelings can sneak up on
  			you and derail your budget. Have you ever purchased
  			something on a whim and later experienced serious buyers
  			remorse? Whether these purchases are because you are bored
  			or stressed, fall into the trap of peer-pressure or can’t pass
  			up an awesome deal, it’s important to have awareness on what
  			emotions drive our spending behavior.</p>

  		<p>Think you already know what your emotional vices are? I wouldn’t
  			be so sure, your feelings can mislead you and tempt you to blow your
  			budget. It’s important to get to know your emotional spending habit,
  			to really live your best life. Most of us would like to believe that
  			we aren’t pressured into purchases or that we don’t spend money just
  			because we are stressed, but in reality, our emotions play a larger
  			role than we think.  </p>

  		<p>Take our quiz to learn more about what your emotional drivers are.
  			It isn’t likely that you will be able to stop making emotional purchases
  			entirely, but by bringing some awareness into the picture, hopefully you
  			can decrease the damage to your bank account.  So what are you waiting
  			for? See if your assumptions about yourself hold up--take the quiz now.</p>

            <p>You are a social spender. Whether it is due to the fear of
              missing out or peer pressure from your friends you can’t
              help but spend money in social situations. Social spenders
              will make every effort to be included in nights out, trips,
              and events. Even if you don’t have the money set aside for that
              vacation with your besties you will move money around to make it work.</p>

            <p>Social spenders often find themselves overspending just to keep up
              with their companions. After a night out, do you wake up regretting
              that you spent more than you had intended? Social spenders fear missing out,
              being excluded from their group, and being judged by their peers.</p>

        <div id="resultTips">
          <p>
            So how do you avoid the peer pressure and stick to
            your budget? First, be honest. Explain your situation
            and your financial goals. Whether you are trying to
            pay off your student loans, buy your first home, or
            save up for future trips, have a heart to heart
            with your friends.</p>

          <p>After you have had a candid conversation, it won’t be a
            surprise when you suggest free or inexpensive activities.
            No one said that everything enjoyable must come with a
            price-tag. Come up with low-cost alternatives when your
            friends propose something pricey. Go to a free concert,
            take a hike, or hold off until those Groupon deals arrive.</p>

          <p>Tip number two, get real with your budget. You will probably
            still want to go out with friends on occasion, and unfortunately,
            not everything can be free. See if you can find room in your
            budget to save up for social spending. If your friends
            regularly get drinks on Friday or take an annual trip,
            try to cut back your spending in one area and instead
            allocate it for these events so they don’t take you by surprise.</p>
