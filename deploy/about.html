        <h3 class="title-content">Our Story</h3>

        <div class="story-block">
          <p>Out of failure comes focus; and kinship springs from unexpected
            corners of life. Our story is no exception.
            <br><br>
            In 2016 Katherine was in the midst of a work sabbatical
            and finally enjoying long-overdue time with her son. Given her
            newly-discovered breathing room she reflected on her past work
            experiences, what she had learned, and how she could grow, all
            in contemplation of her next career move.
            <br><br>
            Sunny was in a similar place, financially and emotionally recovering
            from a recent business setback. Despite his feelings of frustration
            and defeat, his entrepreneurial spirit remained and &mdash; true to form &mdash;
            an inkling of a new idea emerged. However, Sunny wanted to test this
            new idea and sought advice on how to interview people about their
            finances. 
            <br><br>
            We connected  through a mutual friend. Katherine was intrigued by Sunny's 
            desire to learn and place empathy at the core of his idea. Too many times 
            founders are scared to be wrong, and here was someone who practically 
            invited it.
            <br><br>
            In fact, the more we learned about each other, the more we realized how much 
            we shared. How, as creative thinkers and problem-solvers, we were often 
            sidelined and brushed off in previous work environments.
            <br><br>
            We had similar history with money &mdash; both of us experienced financial volatility 
            during childhood and adulthood; every good habit came at the cost of a tough 
            lesson we had to learn on our own.
            <br><br>
            We were determined to not let our past define us but rather to drive us. And 
            that led us to a natural conclusion: build a company based on empathy.
          </p>

      <h3 class="title-content lastTitleContent">Our Beliefs</h3>

      <div class="story-block last-story-block">
        <p>
          <span>Financial Wellness is Emotional Wellness</span>
          <br><br>
          
          At Clasp, we believe financial wellness and emotional wellness are intertwined. 
          To get to the heart of financial matters involves getting to the heart of what 
          drives us: our emotions.
          <br><br>
          As a result, we've replaced lifeless budgeting and passive money-tracking
          with a holistic approach: a long-term plan, plus daily guidance in
          making smart changes and good habits that stick.
          <br><br>
          Money mastery is a continual process; evolving and changing. What worked
          five years ago may not work today. But knowing who you are and what
          motivates you will better prepare you to roll with it when life
          eventually happens.
          <br><br>  
        </p>

        <p>
          <span>Listen First, Design Later</span>
          <br><br>
            We built Clasp side-by-side with real people, beginning with understanding 
            their stories and financial lives. As we listened we were struck by the amount of 
            shame and pain people felt about their past and current behaviors. The 
            self-doubt and criticism. The feelings of hopelessness. Feelings that were 
            all-too-familiar to both of us.
          <br><br>

          <span>Come as you are. Let's get better together.</span>

          <div class="horiz-line"></div>
          <div class="question-content">
            <h4>Why did you start Clasp?</h4>
            <p>For me, financial apps always focused on "other" 
              people who had their finances completely optimized 
              and figured out. But if you're not one of those 
              "others", financial apps can be overwhelming and sad. 
              I wanted to get away from the "you can't" and "you shouldn't" 
              and more into helping people understand themselves. It's not 
              bad to buy something, as long as that reason is thoughtful 
              and purposeful. Being in control of your finances doesn't 
              mean you can't ever buy anything; it means you understand 
              why you're spending.</p>
      
            <h4>Why did you choose to work with Sunny?</h4>
            <p>Sunny is just that - Sunny! He's always bright 
              and optimistic; no challenge is too great. Any time 
              I have a new idea, he listens with an open mind. We 
              get each other; and yet we balance each other out.</p>
      
            <h4>What is your money story?</h4>
            <p>I've always had a complicated relationship with money, 
              and as a result have a mix of good habits and not-so-good 
              habits. Money was never really discussed directly when I was 
              growing up, so a lot of what I know, I've had to learn on my own. 
              I've made a lot of big mistakes before I discovered what works 
              for me. I define success as knowing yourself and unpacking your 
              bad habits; <span>why did I do that?</span> It's tough work, but on the 
              upside you understand how to forgive yourself, recognize 
              your good habits, and build from there.</p>
      
            <h4>What's your spending style?</h4>
            <p>I'm definitely not a minimalist, and I'm definitely not a "stuff" 
              person. I'm a frivolist! I'm a sucker for ridiculous items that 
              make me laugh. I bought a series of tiny poseable plastic skeletons 
              from Japan and I pose them in a few potted plants around my house. 
              Are they necessary? Absolutely not! Do they make me smile every 
              time I see them? Yes! Are they worth it? YES!</p>
      
            <h4>What's your best money hack?</h4>
            <p style='margin-bottom: 50px;'>Honestly, giving myself a monthly allowance has been the most helpful. 
              I basically automate a monthly allowance to a separate account and that 
              is my fun money - shoes or dining out with friends…whatever I want. 
              But it needs to come out of that account. Plus if I sell something 
              or earn anything extra, I put it back into my fun money account.</p>

              intelligence program wrote it. Maybe I'm scared 
              to throw it away?

              <h4>Why did you start Clasp?</h4>
              <p>For me this is personal. When my last company failed, I went from making a lot of money to drowning in business debt in a short amount of time. And that feeling of powerlessness is something I think about a lot as it really clouded my perspective in trying to find a path forward out of what seemed like an impossible situation. Ultimately, I was able to get myself out and redefine my approach to money, an approach that is more self-aware and empowering. My reasons for starting Clasp is to help others redefine their relationship with money in a holistic way that is honest and rooted in emotional self-awareness.</p>
        
              <h4>Why did you choose to work with Katherine?</h4>
              <p>Katherine is one of the most thoughtful women I know. She has this ability to take a problem and deconstruct it to a much deeper level in a way I would have never even thought. When building this company it was so important for me to collaborate with someone who has a deeper perspective on the world and Katherine has just that. I thoroughly enjoy working with her.</p>
        
              <h4>What is your money story?</h4>
              <p>Since my parents were immigrant entrepreneurs, we moved around quite a bit (internationally) and I experienced a lot of income volatility growing up. Because of this, I've always been acutely aware of the relationship between finances and emotional well-being.  But after my last company failed pretty badly in 2016, I hit rock bottom financially, and it was at this point I really felt the weight of how money problems can create a tremendous emotional burden. And while I've since recovered both financially and emotionally, I strongly believe that managing your own personal finances is inherently an emotional process. And honoring that link between money and mindset is paramount to redefining financial behavior.</p>
        
              <h4>What's your spending style?</h4>
              <p>My spending style can be summed up in one word, seasonal. If you look at my credit card statements, you'd be convinced that entirely different humans are using my cards during the summer versus the colder months. And that's because generally during the year, I'm a workaholic and when I'm in the zone, I just don't have time to spend money. But during summer, all bets are off and I totally let loose. I'm super inclined to buy that extra round of drinks or that pricey pair of sunglasses because YOLO!</p>
        
              <h4>What's your best money hack?</h4>
              <p style='margin-bottom: 50px;'>I used to have this terrible habit of spending while I was sad. What took months of disciplined savings would be wiped out in a single evening shopping spree after a bad day. So I promised myself I would kick this habit, I mean it's okay for me to feel sad about a bad day but it's not okay for me to be destructive about it. My solution? I keep a list on the notes app in my phone of ten free things I can do when I'm feeling sad. And I promise myself that whenever I'm feeling sad, I would do at least 5 of the things on the list *before* making any financial purchases. And so far, I've only had one bad shopping spree in the past year!</p>
