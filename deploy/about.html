        <h3 class="title-content">Our Story</h3>

        <div class="story-block">
          <p>Out of failure comes focus; and kinship springs from unexpected
            corners of life. Our story is no exception.
            <br><br>
            In 2016 Katherine was in the midst of a work sabbatical
            and finally enjoying long-overdue time with her son. Given her
            newly-discovered breathing room she reflected on her past work
            experiences, what she had learned, and how she could grow, all
            in contemplation of her next career move.
            <br><br>
            Sunny was in a similar place, financially and emotionally recovering
            from a recent business setback. Despite his feelings of frustration
            and defeat, his entrepreneurial spirit remained and – true to form –
            an inkling of a new idea emerged. However, Sunny wanted to test this
            new idea and sought advice on how to interview people about their
            finances. And so Sunny was connected to Katherine through a mutual
            <span class="only-for-mobila">friend. Katherine was intrigued by Sunny’s desire to learn and place empathy
              at the core of his idea. Too many times founders are scared to be
              wrong, and here was someone who practically invited it. </span>
          </p>

          <p>
            <span class="not-for-mobila">friend. Katherine was intrigued by Sunny’s desire to learn and place empathy
              at the core of his idea. Too many times founders are scared to be
              wrong, and here was someone who practically invited it.  
              <br><br>
          </span>
            In fact, the more we learned about each other, the more we realized
            how much we shared. How, as creative thinkers and problem-solvers,
            we were often sidelined and brushed off in previous work environments. 
            <br><br>
            We had similar history with money – both of us experienced financial
            volatility during childhood and adulthood; every good habit came at
            the cost of a tough lesson we had to learn on our own.
            <br><br>
            Both of us were determined to not let our past define us but rather
            to <i>drive</i> us. And that led us to a natural conclusion: build a company
            based on empathy.
          </p>

        <h3 class="title-content">Our Mission</h3>

        <div class="story-block">
          <p>
            <span>Listen First, Design Later</span>
            <br><br>
            We built Clasp side-by-side with real people, beginning with
            understanding their stories and financial lives. As we listened
            we were struck by the amount of shame and pain people felt about
            their past and current behaviors. The self-doubt and criticism.
            The feelings of hopelessness. Feelings that were all-too-familiar
            to both of us. 
            <br><br>
            <span>Financial Wellness = Emotional Wellness</span>
            <br><br>
            At Clasp, we believe financial wellness and emotional wellness are
            intertwined. To get to the heart of financial matters involves
            getting
          </p>

          <p>
            to the heart of what drives us: our emotions.
            <br><br>
            As a result, we’ve replaced lifeless budgeting and passive money-tracking
            with a holistic approach: a long-term plan, plus daily guidance in
            making smart changes and good habits that stick.
            <br><br>
            Money mastery is a continual process; evolving and changing. What worked
            five years ago may not work today. But knowing who you are and what
            motivates you will better prepare you to roll with it when life
            eventually happens.  
            <br><br>
            <span>Come as you are. Let’s get better together.</span>

                <h4>Why did you start Clasp?</h4>
                <p>For me, financial apps always focused on “other” 
                  people who had their finances completely optimized 
                  and figured out. But if you’re not one of those 
                  “others”, financial apps can be overwhelming and sad. 
                  I wanted to get away from the “you can’t” and “you shouldn’t” 
                  and more into helping people understand themselves. It’s not 
                  bad to buy something, as long as that reason is thoughtful 
                  and purposeful. Being in control of your finances doesn’t 
                  mean you can’t ever buy anything; it means you understand 
                  why you’re spending.</p>
          
                <h4>Why did you choose to work with Sunny?</h4>
                <p>Sunny is just that - Sunny! He’s always bright 
                  and optimistic; no challenge is too great. Any time 
                  I have a new idea, he listens with an open mind. We 
                  get each other; and yet we balance each other out.</p>
          
                <h4>What is your money story?</h4>
                <p>I’ve always had a complicated relationship with money, 
                  and as a result have a mix of good habits and not-so-good 
                  habits. Money was never really discussed directly when I was 
                  growing up, so a lot of what I know, I’ve had to learn on my own. 
                  I’ve made a lot of big mistakes before I discovered what works 
                  for me. I define success as knowing yourself and unpacking your 
                  bad habits; <span>why did I do that?</span> It’s tough work, but on the 
                  upside you understand how to forgive yourself, recognize 
                  your good habits, and build from there.</p>
          
                <h4>What’s your spending style?</h4>
                <p>I’m definitely not a minimalist, and I’m definitely not a “stuff” 
                  person. I’m a frivolist! I’m a sucker for ridiculous items that 
                  make me laugh. I bought a series of tiny poseable plastic skeletons 
                  from Japan and I pose them in a few potted plants around my house. 
                  Are they necessary? Absolutely not! Do they make me smile every 
                  time I see them? Yes! Are they worth it? YES!</p>
          
                <h4>What’s your best money hack?</h4>
                <p>Honestly, giving myself a monthly allowance has been the most helpful. 
                  I basically automate a monthly allowance to a separate account and that 
                  is my fun money - shoes or dining out with friends…whatever I want. 
                  But it needs to come out of that account. Plus if I sell something 
                  or earn anything extra, I put it back into my fun money account.</p>

                  From a boardwalk arcade game in Santa Monica. 
                  I was with my husband on the boardwalk and tucked 
                  it into my wallet. The fortune is not particularly 
                  meaningful; in fact it reads like an artificial

                <h4>Why did you start Clasp?</h4>
                <p>For me, financial apps always focused on “other” 
                  people who had their finances completely optimized 
                  and figured out. But if you’re not one of those 
                  “others”, financial apps can be overwhelming and sad. 
                  I wanted to get away from the “you can’t” and “you shouldn’t” 
                  and more into helping people understand themselves. It’s not 
                  bad to buy something, as long as that reason is thoughtful 
                  and purposeful. Being in control of your finances doesn’t 
                  mean you can’t ever buy anything; it means you understand 
                  why you’re spending.</p>
          
                <h4>Why did you choose to work with Sunny?</h4>
                <p>Sunny is just that - Sunny! He’s always bright 
                  and optimistic; no challenge is too great. Any time 
                  I have a new idea, he listens with an open mind. We 
                  get each other; and yet we balance each other out.</p>
          
                <h4>What is your money story?</h4>
                <p>I’ve always had a complicated relationship with money, 
                  and as a result have a mix of good habits and not-so-good 
                  habits. Money was never really discussed directly when I was 
                  growing up, so a lot of what I know, I’ve had to learn on my own. 
                  I’ve made a lot of big mistakes before I discovered what works 
                  for me. I define success as knowing yourself and unpacking your 
                  bad habits; <span>why did I do that?</span> It’s tough work, but on the 
                  upside you understand how to forgive yourself, recognize 
                  your good habits, and build from there.</p>
          
                <h4>What’s your spending style?</h4>
                <p>I’m definitely not a minimalist, and I’m definitely not a “stuff” 
                  person. I’m a frivolist! I’m a sucker for ridiculous items that 
                  make me laugh. I bought a series of tiny poseable plastic skeletons 
                  from Japan and I pose them in a few potted plants around my house. 
                  Are they necessary? Absolutely not! Do they make me smile every 
                  time I see them? Yes! Are they worth it? YES!</p>
          
                <h4>What’s your best money hack?</h4>
                <p>Honestly, giving myself a monthly allowance has been the most helpful. 
                  I basically automate a monthly allowance to a separate account and that 
                  is my fun money - shoes or dining out with friends…whatever I want. 
                  But it needs to come out of that account. Plus if I sell something 
                  or earn anything extra, I put it back into my fun money account.</p>

                <p>
                  From a boardwalk arcade game in Santa Monica. 
                  I was with my husband on the boardwalk and tucked 
                  it into my wallet. The fortune is not particularly 
                  meaningful; in fact it reads like an artificial 
                  intelligence program wrote it. Maybe 
                  I’m scared to throw it away?

                <li class="to-top">6. Note from Son</li>
                <p>Drawn for me when he was six years old. 
                  I would tuck notes into his lunchbox and 
                  he decided I should have one too. I believe 
                  it is a cat from Neko Atsume along with a 
                  rhebus message - “I love you infinity”
