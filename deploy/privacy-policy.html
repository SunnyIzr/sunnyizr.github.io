          Clasp Privacy Policy 
        </h3>
      
        <p>
          Updated: February 21, 2020
        </p>
      
        <p>Clasp, located at 535 West 49th Street, Apt 2FE, 
          New York, NY 10019 ("Clasp," "we," or "our"), 
          recognizes the importance of your personal privacy. 
          Therefore, we have created this Privacy Policy so that 
          you know how we use and disclose your information when you 
          make it available to us. The Privacy Policy below discloses 
          our practices regarding data collection and usage for the 
          website located at www.clasp.app, the related mobile website, 
          and the mobile application called Clasp (the "App") and 
          the service provided thereon (collectively, the "Service").
        </p>
      
        <p>By using or accessing the Service, you signify your agreement 
          to be bound by this Privacy Policy. 
          <span class="uperCase">IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY YOU 
            MAY NOT ACCESS OR OTHERWISE USE OUR SERVICE 
            OR PARTICIPATE IN OUR SERVICE.<span>
        </p>
      
        <p>Key aspects of our privacy practices 
          described in this Privacy Policy include 
          the following explanations:
        </p>
      
        <ul>
          <li>The data that we collect and why we collect it;</li>
          <li>How we use that data;</li>
          <li>How we share data;</li>
          <li>The rights to your data.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h4>
          Personal Data That We Collect:
        </h4>
      
        <p>
          You may be required to submit certain 
          personal data when you register on the Service. 
          The personal data which you may provide to us could 
          include your email, name, date of birth, IP address, 
          and other personal data collected from you or through 
          some other form of consent from you or 
          notification to you.
        </p>
        
        <h4>
          Non-Personal Or Aggregate Data That We Collect:
        </h4>
      
        <p>
          When you access our Service, we may 
          automatically collect non-personal data 
          from you, such as web pages viewed, browser 
          type, operating system, referring service, 
          search information, device type, page views, 
          usage and browsing habits on the Service and 
          similar data. We may also aggregate demographic 
          information collected from our users 
          (such as the number of users in a particular geographical location) 
          in a manner which does not identify any one individual. 
          We may also aggregate information collected offline in 
          connection with the Service, obtain non-personal data 
          from third party sources and develop aggregate data 
          by anonymizing previously collected personal data.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          It is possible at times when collecting 
          non-personal data through automatic means 
          that we may unintentionally collect or 
          receive personal data that is mixed in with 
          the non-personal data. While we will make 
          reasonable efforts to prevent such incidental data
          collection, the possibility still exists. 
          If you believe that we have inadvertently 
          collected your personal data, please 
          notify us at hello@clasp.app.
        </p>
      
        <h4>

        <p>
          We will only use your personal data as described 
          below, unless you have specifically consented 
          to another type of use, either at the time 
          the personal data is collected from you or 
          through some other form of consent from 
          you or notification to you:

          Analytics and Conversion Tracking:
        </h4>
      
        <p>
          We use analytics services that use cookies, javascript 
          and similar technologies to help us analyze how users 
          use the Service. The information generated by these 
          services about your use of the Service 
          (including your IP address or a truncated version of your IP address) 
          is transmitted to and stored by analytics service providers on their 
          servers. Those service providers will use this information for the 
          purpose of evaluating your, and other users', use of the Service, 
          compiling reports for us on website activity and providing other 
          services relating to website activity and Internet usage. 
        </p>
      
        <p>
          We may collect information about your device, 
          including your IP address, operating system and browser 
          type, for system administration and in order to create reports. 
          This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and 
          patterns, and does not identify any individual.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          We use cookies on our site for Google Analytics, 
          Firebase, and Mixpanel (the "Analytic Services"). 
          The Analytics Services are web and mobile analytics 
          tools that help website and mobile application owners 
          understand how visitors engage with their website 
          and/or mobile application. Customers of the Analytics 
          Services can view a variety of reports about how 
          visitors interact with their website and mobile 
          application so that they can improve them. 
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Like many services, the Analytics Services 
          use first-party cookies to track visitor 
          interactions as in our case, where they are 
          used to collect information about how visitors 
          use our site. We then use the information to 
          compile reports and to help us improve our site.

          such as the time that the current visit occurred, 
          whether the visitor has been to the site before and 
          what site referred the visitor to the web page.

          Google Analytics collects information anonymously.

          Cookies and Similar Technologies:
        </h4>

        <p>
          "Cookies" are pieces of information that may be placed on your computer by a service for the purpose of facilitating and enhancing your communication and interaction with that service. Many services use cookies for these purposes.  We may use cookies (and similar items such as clear gifs, web beacons, tags, etc.) on our Service to customize your visit and for other purposes to make your visit more convenient or to enable us to enhance our Service.  We may also use and place cookies (and similar items) on your computer from our third party service providers in connection with the Service.  In addition, our advertisers and business partners may set cookies and similar items on your computer when you use our Service.  You may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or flush them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences, in which case you may still use our Service, but it may interfere with some of its functionality. Cookies and similar items are not used by us to automatically retrieve personally identifiable information from your computer without your knowledge.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you delete your cookies, change browsers or use a different cookie, our cookie (or an opt-out cookie) may no longer work and you will have to reinput (or opt-out) again.

        <h4>
          Automatically Collected Information: 
        </h4>

        <p>
          When you access the Service or open one of our HTML emails, we may automatically record certain information from your system by using cookies and other types of tracking technologies. This "automatically collected" information may include Internet Protocol address ("IP Address"), a unique user ID, device type, device identifiers, browser types and language, referring and exit pages, platform type, version of software installed, system type, the content and pages that you access on the Service, the number of clicks, the amount of time spent on pages, the dates and times that you visit the Service, and other similar information. Depending on the law of your country of residence, your IP address may be considered personal data.
        </p>

        <h4>
          Security:
        </h4>
      
        <p>
          The security of your personal data is very important to us. 
          When we collect your personal data online, we use reasonable 
          efforts to protect it from unauthorized access. However, 
          due to the inherent open nature of the Internet, we cannot 
          guarantee that your personal data will be completely free 
          from unauthorized access by third parties such as hackers 
          and your use of our Service demonstrates your assumption of 
          this risk. We have put in place reasonable physical, electronic, 
          and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect. 
          Only those employees who need access to your information in order to 
          perform their duties are authorized to have access to your personal data.

          We shall investigate and report data breaches within 
          72 hours of becoming aware of such breach. When a 
          breach of Personal Data is likely to result in a high risk 
          to the rights and freedoms of individuals then Clasp, as 
          Controller, will notify the affected individuals 
          without undue delay.

          Protection for Children:
        </h4>
      
        <p>
          We generally do not collect personal data from 
          children under the age of 13. If at any time in 
          the future we plan to collect personal data from 
          children under 13, such collection and use, to the 
          extent applicable, shall, when required, be done 
          in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy 
          Protection Act ("COPPA") and appropriate consent 
          from the child's parent or guardian will be sought 
          where required by COPPA. When we become aware that 
          personal data from a child under 13 has been collected 
          without such child's parent or guardian's consent, we will 
          use all reasonable efforts to delete such 
          information from our database.
