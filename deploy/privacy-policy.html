          CLASP PRIVACY POLICY 
        </h3>
      
        <p>
          Updated: June 26, 2019
        </p>
      
        <p>Clasp, located at 535 West 49th Street, 
          Apt 2FE, New York, NY 10019 ("Clasp," "we," or "our"), 
          recognizes the importance of your personal privacy.  
          Therefore, we have created this Privacy Policy so that 
          you know how we use and disclose your information when you 
          make it available to us.  The Privacy Policy below discloses 
          our practices regarding data collection and usage for the 
          website located at www.clasp.app, the related mobile website, 
          and the mobile application called Clasp (the “App”) and 
          the service provided thereon (collectively, the “Service”).
        </p>
      
        <p>By using or accessing the Service, you signify your agreement 
          to be bound by this Privacy Policy. 
          <span class="uperCase">IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY YOU 
            MAY NOT ACCESS OR OTHERWISE USE OUR SERVICE 
            OR PARTICIPATE IN OUR SERVICE.<span>
        </p>
      
        <p>Key aspects of our privacy practices 
          described in this Privacy Policy include 
          the following explanations:
        </p>
      
        <ul>
          <li>The data that we collect and why we collect it;</li>
          <li>How we use that data;</li>
          <li>How we share data;</li>
          <li>The rights to your data.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h4>
          Personal Data That We Collect:
        </h4>
      
        <p>
          You may be required to submit certain 
          personal data when you register on the Service. 
          The personal data which you may provide to us could 
          include your email, name, date of birth, IP address, 
          and other personal data collected from you or through 
          some other form of consent from you or 
          notification to you.
        </p>
        
        <h4>
          Non-Personal Or Aggregate Data That We Collect:
        </h4>
      
        <p>
          When you access our Service, we may 
          automatically collect non-personal data 
          from you, such as web pages viewed, browser 
          type, operating system, referring service, 
          search information, device type, page views, 
          usage and browsing habits on the Service and 
          similar data. We may also aggregate demographic 
          information collected from our users 
          (such as the number of users in a particular geographical location) 
          in a manner which does not identify any one individual.   
          We may also aggregate information collected offline in 
          connection with the Service, obtain non-personal data 
          from third party sources and develop aggregate data 
          by anonymizing previously collected personal data.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          It is possible at times when collecting 
          non-personal data through automatic means 
          that we may unintentionally collect or 
          receive personal data that is mixed in with 
          the non-personal data.  While we will make 
          reasonable efforts to prevent such incidental data
          collection, the possibility still exists.  
          If you believe that we have inadvertently 
          collected your personal data, please 
          notify us at hello@clasp.app.
        </p>
      
        <h4>
          Information Usage:
        </h4>
      
        <p>
          We will only use your personal data as described 
          below, unless you have specifically consented 
          to another type of use, either at the time 
          the personal data is collected from you or 
          through some other form of consent from 
          you or notification to you:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
      
          <li>

          <li>We may use your personal data to send you emails from time to 
            time about our services, but we will not provide your personal 
            data to third parties for them to contact you directly unless 
            otherwise permitted by this Privacy Policy or you 
            provide your consent.
          </li>
      
          <li>
              We may share your personal data with third parties

              information to us. Specifically, we may share your 
              information with the third party vendors listed below 
              (collectively, the “Third Party Vendors”). <strong>We urge 
              you to read the privacy practices of all of our 
              Third Party Vendors before submitting any 
              personal data through the Service.</strong>

            We may disclose personal data to investigate

            policies for our services or our sponsors.

            which your personal data is associated.
          </li>
      
          <li>
            We may share your personal data with an affiliate of Clasp

          Non- personally identifiable or aggregate information

        <h4>
          Analytics and Conversion Tracking:
        </h4>
      
        <p>
          We use analytics services that use cookies, javascript 
          and similar technologies to help us analyze how users 
          use the Service. The information generated by these 
          services about your use of the Service 
          (including your IP address or a truncated version of your IP address) 
          is transmitted to and stored by analytics service providers on their 
          servers. Those service providers will use this information for the 
          purpose of evaluating your, and other users’, use of the Service, 
          compiling reports for us on website activity and providing other 
          services relating to website activity and Internet usage. 
        </p>
      
        <p>
          We may collect information about your device, 
          including your IP address, operating system and browser 
          type, for system administration and in order to create reports. 
          This is statistical data about our users’ browsing actions and 
          patterns, and does not identify any individual.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          We use cookies on our site for Google Analytics, 
          Firebase, and Mixpanel (the “Analytic Services”). 
          The Analytics Services are web and mobile analytics 
          tools that help website and mobile application owners 
          understand how visitors engage with their website 
          and/or mobile application. Customers of the Analytics 
          Services can view a variety of reports about how 
          visitors interact with their website and mobile 
          application so that they can improve them. 
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Like many services, the Analytics Services 
          use first-party cookies to track visitor 
          interactions as in our case, where they are 
          used to collect information about how visitors 
          use our site. We then use the information to 
          compile reports and to help us improve our site.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Cookies contain information that is transferred to 
          your computer’s hard drive and/or personal electronic 
          device. These cookies are used to store information, 
          such as the time that the current visit occurred, 
          whether the visitor has been to the site before and 
          what site referred the visitor to the web page.

        <p>
          Google Analytics collects information anonymously. 
          It reports website trends without identifying individual 
          visitors. You can opt out of Google Analytics without

          Security:
        </h4>
      
        <p>
          The security of your personal data is very important to us. 
          When we collect your personal data online, we use reasonable 
          efforts to protect it from unauthorized access.  However, 
          due to the inherent open nature of the Internet, we cannot 
          guarantee that your personal data will be completely free 
          from unauthorized access by third parties such as hackers 
          and your use of our Service demonstrates your assumption of 
          this risk.  We have put in place reasonable physical, electronic, 
          and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect. 
          Only those employees who need access to your information in order to 
          perform their duties are authorized to have access to your personal data. 
          For more information on protecting your privacy, please visit 
          <a href="www.ftc.gov/privacy.">
            www.ftc.gov/privacy.
          </a>
        </p>
      
        <p>
          We shall investigate and report data breaches within 
          72 hours of becoming aware of such breach. When a 
          breach of Personal Data is likely to result in a high risk 
          to the rights and freedoms of individuals then Clasp, as 
          Controller, will notify the affected individuals 
          without undue delay.
        </p>
      
        <h4>
          Your Disclosures In Blogs And Other Social Media:
        </h4>
      
        <p>
          You should be aware that personal data which you 
          voluntarily include and transmit online on the Service 
          or in a publicly accessible blog, chat room, social 
          media platform or otherwise online, or that you share 
          in an open forum such as an in-person panel or 
          survey, may be viewed and used by others without 
          any restrictions.  We are unable to control such 
          uses of your personal data, and by using the Service 
          or any other online services you assume the risk that 
          the personal data provided by you may be viewed and 
          used by third parties for any number of purposes.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          If you connect to a third party service such as Facebook 
          or Twitter through an icon or link on the Service or 
          otherwise link your Clasp account with a third party 
          service, we may share the contents of your post and 
          associated information (such as your user name, the fact 
          that your connection originated from the Service, and 
          other relevant usage and diagnostic information) with 
          such third party.  With your one-time consent, we may also 
          send information about the content you watch and your 
          activities on the Service to such third parties. Once such 
          information is shared, the use of your information will be 
          subject to that service's privacy policy and this 
          Privacy Policy will not apply.
        </p>
      
        <h4>
          Protection for Children:
        </h4>
      
        <p>
          We generally do not collect personal data from 
          children under the age of 13.  If at any time in 
          the future we plan to collect personal data from 
          children under 13, such collection and use, to the 
          extent applicable, shall, when required, be done 
          in compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy 
          Protection Act (“COPPA”) and appropriate consent 
          from the child’s parent or guardian will be sought 
          where required by COPPA.  When we become aware that 
          personal data from a child under 13 has been collected 
          without such child’s parent or guardian’s consent, we will 
          use all reasonable efforts to delete such 
          information from our database.
        </p>
      
        <h4>
          Other Services:
        </h4>
      
        <p>As a convenience to you, we may provide links to third-party 
          services from within our Service. We are not responsible for 
          the privacy practices or content of these third-party sites.  
          When you link away from our Service, you do so at your own risk.
        </p>
      
        <h4>
          Changes to this Privacy Policy:
        </h4>
      
        <p>
          We reserve the right, at our discretion, 
          to change, modify, add, or remove portions 
          from this Privacy Policy at any time. However, 
          if at any time in the future we plan to use 
          personal data in a way that materially differs 
          from this Privacy Policy, including sharing such 
          information with more third parties, we will email 
          you and give you the opportunity to review the revised 
          policy before you choose to continue using our Services.
        </p>
      
        <h4>
          User Access to Data:
        </h4>
      
        <p>
          You have the right to request access to the data 
          information we have stored on you. You can do this 
          by contacting us at hello@clasp.app. We will make 
          sure to provide you with a copy of the saved data 
          particular to you. In order to comply with your request, 
          we may ask you to verify your identity. We will fulfill
