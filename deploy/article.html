          In this series, we explore money and relationships. This week Megan talks about 
          the need to have financial conversations with your partner and offers tips on 
          how to navigate those conversations.

      <p> 
        Most individuals loathe talking about money. Among family, friends, and 
        coworkers it is a subject rarely discussed. Perhaps because it is awkward to talk 
        about, and people worry about wage inadequacies or their financial 
        shortcomings. Or possibly, it is because of the strong emotions and meanings 
        associated with money such as power and security.
      </p> 

      <p> 
        When it comes to dating, the only instance in which money is openly discussed 
        is deciding who is going to pay for dinner. But not talking about finances with 
        your partner, or even your date, can spell relationship failure. It's completely 
        understandable that when you are looking for Mr. or Ms. Right, you are looking 
        for compatibility in multiple areas, not just how well off they are. 
      </p> 
        
      <div class="client-text-block">

          You will have to bare all regarding your money situation. 
          This can be much, much, harder than actually stripping 
          down with your significant other (and a lot less fun).
        </p>
      </div>

        But money topics usually account for a great deal of stress in a relationship. 
        Especially, as it progresses. Each partner's finances will determine what goals 
        you can obtain as a couple. And typically these are big goals, such as buying a 
        house, paying off a student loan, or even being able to start a family. Because 
        finances play such a big role in such impactful life decisions, you need to start 
        with a good foundation.
      </p>
          
      <p> 
        Asking to see the other person's tax returns on the first date probably isn’t 
        socially acceptable. However, waiting to discuss finances until you are walking 
        down the aisle is not wise either. After an acceptable period of dating, financial 
        compatibility is an area in which you should assess your partner. But beware, 
        this does not mean that you only date people who earn above a certain 
        amount, or ghost someone because they make less than you.
      </p>

      <p>
        You are trying to determine your beau’s habits, feelings, and attitude towards 
        money. Knowing how much debt they bring to the table is also important. As 
        previously discussed in the money series, open communication is vital. You will 
        need to have a conversation regarding money, and likely more than one.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether you have been dating for three months or three years, here are the 
        “money talks” you should be having. Talking about money progresses through 
        three simple topics: your current financial state, your financial goals, and 
        finally, how to balance your obligations with your goals as a couple.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="textBlock">
      <span>Lay your cards on the table</span>
      <p>
        The first conversation can bring back feelings of middle school gym class and 
        having to change in the locker room. Totally awkward. You will have to bare all 
        regarding your money situation. This can be much, much, harder than actually 
        stripping down with your significant other (and a lot less fun).
      </p>

      <p>
        By the end of the conversation, you should have a pretty good idea of the other 
        person's debts, habits, and income. In general, their financial standing. The 
        ratio of how much they earn to how much they owe will factor into what goals 
        you can set, and their timelines; should you decide to get married.
      </p>

      <p>
        Also, if marriage is in the future, you will want to know their spending and 
        saving habits. This is where compatibility is a factor. Just as wanting or not 
        wanting children can be a deal-breaker, so can financially risky spending 
        habits. Therefore, it's better to have this conversation sooner rather than later.
      </p>

        <span>To infinity and beyond!</span>
        <p>
          In case it isn’t clear, this convo is all about growing old together. You and your 
          partner will want to talk about your financial future and any goals or plans you 
          may have. It can be exciting to talk about what your future house will look like 
          and how many future children you plan to have, but in reality, those things cost 
          money.
        </p>

        <p>  
          If you want to buy that home complete with a white picket fence, you likely 
          won’t be attending every concert in town, dining out five nights a week, or jet 
          setting off on vacations. You will want to make sure that each party is on board 
          with the saving and sacrifices necessary to reach financial goals. You don’t 
          have to have a multi-step plan (yet) or be one-hundred percent in sync, but you 
          do have to be willing to make compromises and keep the conversation going.

          Just because you balk at spending a paycheck on a weekend 
          getaway, doesn’t mean you should make your partner feel 
          inferior for doing so. Everyone has different opinions and 
          emotions surrounding money. Unless their spending habits are 
          egregiously terrible (like gambling) or completely out of sync 
          with yours, show some compassion and try to understand why 
          they handle money the way they do.

      <span>A financial union.</span>
      <p>
        You have talked about where you are and where you want to be, now you have 
        to choose how you want to get there. This involves making a budget, possibly 
        meeting with a financial planner, and deciding if you want to combine bank 
        accounts.
      </p>

      <p>
        This conversation largely depends on the stage of your relationship. If you're 
        living together and sharing expenses, at the very least a budget is a good idea. 
        If you are only dating, you can still plan for future financial endeavors and even 
        start saving.
      </p>

      <div class="client-text-block">

      <p>
        The choice of whether or not to share an account is a tricky one. You can read 
        more about that decision in another article in our relationship series.
      </p>


      <p>
        Though this conversation will probably be less uncomfortable than the first 
        two, budgeting as a couple takes patience and consideration.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once you have made it over these three discussion hurdles, don’t let the lines of 
        communication break down. Staying on the same page and checking in with 
        your finances will keep your pocketbooks in good shape and keep you on track 
        to achieve your monetary goals.
