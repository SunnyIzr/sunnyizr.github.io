      <p> When I was 19, I got my first internship at a big bank.
         They offered a 100% 401k matching program and after learning 
         more about the wonders of compound interest in my Finance
          101 class, I was pumped! I studiously calculated how much a
           single    would be worth by the time I retired—assuming a 
           12% rate of return and factoring in the 100% match, it would
            be worth a whopping $326 I discovered. Holy crap! What if 
            I had   ,000 in there, that would be more than $300k. And what 
            about $5,000? Well, that would put me over a million dollars!</p> 

      <p> This was exciting to me, even if it was far into the future.
         Being ahead of the game and starting on retirement young was 
         so motivating for me. And so I did contribute and continued
          to do so when that internship turned into a full time job 
          after I graduated college—a job I would have for another four years. </p> 
        
      <p>  When I was 25, my 401k was at $35k, a number I was very proud of.
         I mean that would be $3.3 million at retirement. 
         But then I did something inexcusable. I liquidated my entire 401k and spent it.
          It was a totally impulsive, spur of the moment decision. 
          What did I spend it on? Well I’ll save that for another blog post.
           But in literally one second, the idea of having many millions
            of dollars by the time I was 65 just stopped being exciting to me. 
            There was something shinier and more fabulous in front of me. 
            That's the funny thing about money. What can take years of
             discipline to build can be so easily wiped out in an instant.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="textBlock">
      <p>It took me years to begin contributing to my 401k 
        again, purely because just the thought of my 401k
         would make me embarrassed and ashamed of my reckless decision. 
         But I do reflect a lot on how I can go from one perspective,
          a more responsible and future-conscious one, to the other end
           of the spectrum, a more reckless, YOLO-centric perspective that
            is only focused on the now. </p>

      <p>    Retirement is not exactly known to be the sexiest 
        topic in life, especially when you’re under the age of 
        35. But the irony is it gets harder to plan for it later 
        in life. So it’s super important to start thinking about 
        when we have time on our side. I had to change my whole 
        thought process in order to get me to start contributing 
        again to that 401k. Here are some shifts in thinking that
         I made to my perspective that have helped me to get excited 
         about the world’s most boring topic:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="textBlock">
      <span>Fall in love with your senior self</span>

      <p>We live in a youth obsessed culture where everything young 
        is idolized. Even in the business world, the media is more 
        in love with the idea of a young college drop out genius than 
        an experienced and measured qualified person to run a company.
         As we all know, this perspective often leads to terrible results.
          This focus on young devalues the great experiences that
           older generations get to experience. Sure, a younger life
            may be more captivating on a screen, but what about all
             those fulfilling and rich experiences older people have
              that the rest of us don’t get to see. What this creates
               is a fear in us of getting older. We start to believe 
               that after a certain age life isn’t even worth living.</p>

      <p>But changing this perspective is important. Especially since 
        there are so many examples of senior citizens who are
         thoroughly enjoying their lives. I mean look at the
          Golden Girls! Sure your life may be different at that 
          age, and you’ll want different things, but the idea of
           being older is not something we should fear. Quite the
            opposite. We should all look forward to getting older,
             when life can be slower and we get to do the things we
              actually want with no fucks given. I mean seriously though. 
              Seniors have no chill, they don’t give a fuck. That is exciting.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="textBlock">
        <span>Think about the upside</span>
        <p>How many times has doom and gloom been associated 
          with the topic of retirement? Healthcare costs are 
          rising they say. Social security will be bankrupt 
          they say. The world will be under water they say. 
          Another reason why it’s so hard to think about retirement 
          is because it’s just so stressful. The idea of being a 
          penniless sixty-something begging for healthcare at the
           steps of a hospital, is a visual that’s all too common
            when thinking about retirement. But here’s the thing.
             When working towards a goal, it’s way easier to think
              about all the great things that will come with accomplishing 
              the goal than to be worried about all the negative things
               that will happen if you don’t accomplish that goal.</p>

        <p>  Instead of thinking the worst case scenario, think 
          about the best case scenario. Being in your 60s with
           millions of dollars in the bank, getting to do 
           whatever you want and not beholden to anyone, is a 
           pretty great scenario to work towards. Not beholden 
           to an employer or even what society expects of you. 
           Because after a certain age our media doesn’t even 
           bother to place standards or expectations. You can actually 
           just do you. True freedom.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="textBlock">
        <span>Be okay with not having your shit together</span>
        <p>A big reason why it took me so long to start contributing
           again to my 401k was because I really felt like I didn’t 
           have my shit together. And a big reason why it was so
            easy for me to contribute at 19 was because I was doing 
            it early and at that point I knew I had my shit together.
             The fact is a lot of people don’t contribute to their 
             401k because they feel like they have too many problems
              today that they need to deal with. And the conventional
               thinking is to try to get your shit together today and 
               then you can worry about retirement.</p>

        <p>But here’s the truth. It’s okay to not have your shit together 
          right now because you’ll never have everything down to perfection. 
          It’s okay to just live in a constant state of incompletion. 
          And it’s important to just accept that there’s no deadline 
          for you to make sure everything needs to be perfect. Incremental 
          progress is still progress. And most of all, accept that 
          you don’t have to wait until today’s problems are solved 
          to solve tomorrow’s. Life does not work in such a linear fashion.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="breakLine"></div>
    <div class="textBlock">
      <p>The good news is that there are so many tools and resources out
         there that make contributions for retirement pretty easy. The h
         ardest part is just setting things up. After those automatic co
         ntributions are set up, you can forget all about it, but still 
         feel a sense of security knowing that your future is being taken 
         care of.  I’m happy to report that I did eventually resume contributing
          to my 401k and in fact I have way more than what I had before I spent
           it all--thanks to my aggressive catch up contributions and this 
           wonderful bull market we’ve been having over the years. But in addition
            to those factors, a big part of my success has been because entire 
            mindset has changed about retirement. And mindset is everything when 
            it comes to making the best financial decisions.</p>
