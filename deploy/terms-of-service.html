          (collectively, the "Websites"), you agree to 
          be bound by these Terms of Use (this "Terms of Use" or "Agreement"), 
          whether or not you register as a Member of Clasp. 
          If you wish to become a Member and/or make use of the

          PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY AS IT 
          CONTAINS IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR LEGAL

          must have access to the World Wide Web, either directly or through 
          devices that access web-based content, and pay any service fees

          In order to use the Service, you must be at least eighteen (18) years of age. 
          By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you have the right, 
          authority and capacity to enter into this Agreement and to abide by all

          4. License for Mobile Application
        </h4>
      
        <p>
          Clasp grants you, subject to your compliance with these 
          Terms of Use, a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable 
          license to download and install a copy of the App. You may 
          download the App on a single device (whether mobile or otherwise) 
          to which you have exclusive control. We reserve all rights in 
          and to the App which are not expressly granted to you under these 
          Terms of Use. You are prohibited from running any version of the 
          App on a jailbroken device.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          You acknowledge and agree that new or updated versions of the App may 
          include new or updated Terms of Use. Because new or updated versions of 
          the App may include enhanced security or fixes to previous security-related 
          problems, the failure to install the new version of the App may expose you 
          to security risks, including without limitation a breach of your 
          personal information.
        </p>

          you represent and warrant that:

        <p>
          <span class="count-header"> a. </span>

          Illegal and/or unauthorized use of the Service may be investigated, and

          others, you may wish to consider disabling your auto-sign in feature if you have 
          it linked to your Clasp account.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          In creating and maintaining your account, you agree to provide 
          accurate information to us at all times. In the event that you 
          discover that you have provided inaccurate or misleading information, 
          you agree to immediately correct such information. If you use an alias 
          as your account name, you agree not to use an alias that is vulgar, 
          defamatory, offensive, or that violates any third party's intellectual 
          property rights or otherwise violates these Terms of Use or the 
          Clasp Privacy Policy.
